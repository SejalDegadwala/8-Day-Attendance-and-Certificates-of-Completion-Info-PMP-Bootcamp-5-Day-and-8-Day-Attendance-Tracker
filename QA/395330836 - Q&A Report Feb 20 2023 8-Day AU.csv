79,What are lead and lag related to float? ,Najibullah Hameed,'-,"Float is the amount of time by which the start of an activity can be delayed without delaying the project completion time. Lag is the amount of wait time between two tasks. Basically, lag is the amount of time by which a successor activity will be delayed. Lead is the amount of time a successor task can be accelerated. Bascially, if you apply a lead to a succesor, it can start before its predessor activity finishes. Using leads and lags can effect the amout of float available in the succesor activity",2/20/2023 20:31,2/20/2023 21:27,David Robichaud
